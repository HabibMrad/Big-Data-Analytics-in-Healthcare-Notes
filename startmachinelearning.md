How to start a good #MachineLearning project?

At a high-level:

Learn Machine Learning (Best 1hour video on ML) https://lnkd.in/gvQ24_C

Find a real-world problem (Healthcare, Ecommerce, Advertising, etc..) Look for a problem that interests you. List of Datasets: [https://github.com/pursh2002/medical-data

Exploratory Data Analysis (Python or R) Understand what patterns and values your data has. Apply different visualizations and statistical testings to back up our findings. Go out and explore!

Use Multiple Models (Simple VS Complex) Try the simplest models first. You'll be amazed how far simple models like Linear/Logistic Regression will take you. Once you've narrowed down and understand how your model performs, then go ahead and try out more complex models (Deep Learning).

Document your work (GitHub or Blog) This is the most important. Document all of your analysis, visualizations, and experiments. Document your failures. Understand why it worked and why it didn't worked.

Showcase your work Share your project with others. Communicate your results & get feedback from the community. This allows you to reflect back on some mistakes you've made and gather further insights to improve on.
