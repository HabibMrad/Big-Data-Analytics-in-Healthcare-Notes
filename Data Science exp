What versus Why: Data Science can be used to discover correlations (What phenomena occurred) but cannot be used to establish 
causality (Why the phenomena occurred).[https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/01/understanding-truth-data-science.html

Data Science involves discovering What – significant facts or patterns concerning phenomena. These are called correlations 
amongst variables. Ideally, data science methods will help us identify highly probably (plausible) hypotheses (correlations) 
that will be proven causal by other means. Data Science involves accelerated methods of discovering THAT correlations occur 
under certain conditions and with certain probabilities; it cannot discover Why – whether the correlations between variables 
are causal, i.e., explain why the observed correlations occurred. Once data science has been used to establish one or more 
highly probable hypotheses (correlations), we put aside data science and turn to the conventional methods of the domain in 
question to establish causality or Why the observed phenomena occurred.

Single Version of Truth: Banks must maintain a single version of truth for your bank account, not multiple versions, since you 
want the bank to make sure that every euro you put in is credited to you and every euro taken out is credited to the person you 
are paying. “One version of truth” applies to most businesses that want a persistent, reliable record of all business 
transactions. Databases were first developed for banking and business; hence they claim to support a single version of truth. 
While this is critical for some problems, e.g., business transactions, it is not true for most of the rest of the world. Hence, 
database products do not support multiple models, i.e., the reality of science and life in general. For over 40 years, 
researchers have tried but failed to develop databases that support multiple perspectives or multiple semantic models.
