Most companies I come across aren't ready to use machine learning.  (sometimes not even close)

Here's a checklist that's a starting point;  
(feedback and prompts in longer version)

1. How much data do you have to analyze?

2. Is part of your goal to sort your data into different categories?

2*. [if answered yes to question 2] Are most (or at least many) of your data points labeled by which category they belong to? 

3. Is your data currently available for use?

4. Is your data currently stored on a computer?

5. Are you working with time series data?

5*. [if answered no to 5] Are you working with tabular data? In other words, is your data contained in tables (as opposed to images, audio or video files)?

5**. [if answered yes to 5*] If you're working with tabular, but answered no to question 5, how many features (equivalent to columns in an excel spreadsheet) does your dataset have?

6. Can you see any trends or patterns in your data already?

7. Do you expect the patterns that are present in your data now to hold in production?

8. How quickly do you need results?
