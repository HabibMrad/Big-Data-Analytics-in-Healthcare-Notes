# Big-Data-Analytics-in-Healthcare
###Modeling and Analysis,Data and Computing,Health Business Context and Problem Solving by
###hands-on experience with scalable machine learning algorithms, big data systems and healthcare data analytic applications

## Goals 
* understanding health care data,
* understanding different analytics algorithms
* understanding big data systems.
* to build models on health care data,example, models for individual disease risk prediction, recommending treatments,
* cluster patient into groups with common characteristics, and find similar patients.

## Problem 
* Healthcare industry is huge. There are a lot of data coming out of healthcare.
* High waste and low quality > 750 billion
* errors and Preventable deaths > 40000

## Health Systems Without Big Data

Most health systems can do plenty today without big data, including meeting most of their analytics and reporting needs.
“air and water” right now (regulatory reporting and operational dashboards), once basic needs are met and some of the initial advanced applications are in place, new use cases can be identifyed in ares of big data. 

## Barriers
* Technical expertise(most organizations need data scientists/data engineers to manipulate and get data out of a big data environment), curruntly only limited to research because of complexity 

* Security : In healthcare, HIPAA compliance is non-negotiable. Nothing is more important than the privacy and security of patient data. 

* Funding 

* Governance and Policy 

## Big data concepts 

### Big Data Has Minimal Structure
Compared to classical relation data bases, where data is stored in schema and linked to different identifiers.Here data has hardly any structure at all. Data is extracted from source systems in its raw form stored in a massive distributed file system.

### four Vs

* Volume- Health generates large amount of data For example, for genomic data each human genome requires 200 gigabyte of raw data, or 125 megabyte if we store just snipps. For medical imaging data a single FMRI is about 300 gigabyte.
Medical imaging data generated in the US per year was estimated to be 100 petabyte.
Healthcare also generates lots of different kinds of information such as clinical informations, including patients demographics, diagnosis, procedure, medication, lab results, and clinical notes.
And patient generated data, such as the information coming out of on-body sensors and other devices that patients wear.
And real-time data sources such as blood pressure measures, temperature, heart rate, drug dispensing levels at intensive care units.

* Varity- sensors/twitter/facebook/etc

* Varecity - Veracity, there's a common problem with the veracity,there's lot of noise, lot of missing data, lot of errors,
and a lot of false alarms.

* velocity - real time data

## Big Data Picture

* Big data systems
* Machine learning Algorithims
* Healthcare Applications

### Healthcare Applications

Three types ....
* Predective Modeling -- to predict future outcome e.g epilepsy 
* Computational Phenotyping -- turning massive EHR to meaning full health concepts 
* Patient Similarity --- to identify group of patients based on similar characteristics
